A library for [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/) that mainly helps with managing item inventories.

This library was originally for my [okstorage](https://github.com/HappySunChild/okstorage) program, but I've decided to rip out the actual library part and make it it's own project (though development will still be pretty interlinked).
